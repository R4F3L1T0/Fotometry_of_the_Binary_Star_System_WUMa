# Fotometry of the Binary Star System WUMa
### Using the "de Ritis" Telescope, equipped with a CCD camera (University of Naples, "Federico II"), we estimate the period of *W Ursae Majoris*, a very important celestial object in Astrophysics.

I worked in a group of three people, the whole project was designed by ourselves. We learnt how to use the telescope, chase a significant, interesting and observable celestial object, and designed the data analysis.  
The ultimate scope was to measure the period of the tight, circular orbit of the pair of stars.     
Our measurements was compatible with the value of the period reported in literature.  
In this repository you find:

  - a detailed Report (**Final_Report.pdf**) of our activities comprising the theoretical backgound on binary star systems, a detailed description of the experimental apparatus
  and the whole data analysis process.
  
  - a final Presentation (**Final_Presentation.pdf**) that schematically resume the 
  the main points of our work, highlights the final results.
  
Unfortunately both the files are in Italian (we were so lazy...).  
We wrote a lot of code to pursue the data analysis but it really needs to be rearranged (we will do it one day).  
The whole dataset is just too big to be uploaded here, if you are interested feel free to contact me.
